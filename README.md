## Ensuring Quality

### Hooks

- GitHub Actions will check the branch and commit message name policy.
  However, you can check it before pushing the code using the **git hooks**
- Make files in `.githooks` executable:
  - `chmod 755 commit-msg`
  - `chmod 755 prepare-commit-msg`
- In order to enable hooks enter the project and use the following command: `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`

### GitHub Actions

- Runs Markdown linter to check .md files
- Runs `Gradle build` to run
  - Code linter and checkstyle `detekt`
  - Runs source files compilation to check possible errors
  - Runs unit and integration tests
  - Build an application
- All build failures are published in [Telegram chat](https://t.me/+nkVX0j3FXo8zMmNi)
