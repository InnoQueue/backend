## InnoQueue: Backend

When you live with 5 other people, you have to manage your household chores.
This could mean taking trash every once in a while or washing dishes.
That said, there is a problem of bearing in mind all those different orders and chores.
And then somebody may take a rain check here and there and you have no idea who's doing what
and there is no way to tell except for boring Excel sheets, but it requires a lot of time and dedication to set up and
maintain a spreadsheet.

So, we present to you the application that can do the heavy lifting of maintaining and automating
all of these nuances for you!

This is how it works: users complete tasks in a queue one by one in a loop.
So, ideally, every roommate should complete a task on each iteration.
You can also have multiple queues go in parallel and there's no confusion!
